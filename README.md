A real-time computer system to prevent head-on traffic collisions

Developed in Spring 2012 for USC's Real Time Computer Systems (EE545) course. This was a team project consisting of A. Hagio, H. Nguyen, L. Sakamoto, and Z. Slavis under the guidance of Prof. Monte Ung.

Developed a RTCS to prevent head-on traffic collisions on a scaled hardware platform consisting of R/C car, microcontroller, and Android-powered smartphone. Project encompassed analog signal processing, Bluetooth communication, motor control, interrupts & scheduling, fault-tolerance & recovery.
